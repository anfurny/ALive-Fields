What is AcControls? 
====================================================================================

AcControls is a php library for binding database fields to html elements. This is done in a live way with ajax and provides a level of immediate interactivity usually only seen in offline database applications like access.

The library is designed to allow database applications to be made online with only a handful of code.

Technical Explanation
====================================================================================
This library operates with a client-side javascript set of controls and a server-side set of handlers. However, there is no need to write javascript as the PHP code will generate default javascript. However, you're free to extend/enhance it with your own javascript.
