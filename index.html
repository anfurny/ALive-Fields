<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>ALive fields (Ajax Live Fields) are a variety of Javascript controls (operating on a provided PHP backend) I built to provide a live, secure, rapid-deployment
database-binding system. The setup I provide here is relatively basic, however it is open source and easy to adapt to your own specific needs.<br />
</p> 
<p>
You can see the <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTLXeKz9Vvo'>youtube screencast</a> on basic usage and functioning. Or you can try the <a href='example.php'>live example</a> out for yourself. You can access the source at   <a href="https://github.com/anfurny/ALive-Fields">https://github.com/anfurny/ALive-Fields</a> .</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>ALive fields requires Jquery, JSON, and its controls require JqueryUI.
<br />
<h2  id="security">Security</h2>
<p>These controls are designed to be entirely secure. This means that they are designed to: not reveal any information about table or field names in the database, not allow editing of fields; rows; or tables by fiddling with requests, and not be susceptible to SQL injection. I highly encourage you to verify the security for yourself on the example; if you can break the security (i.e. fiddling with requests in a way that lets you change or view data that could not be changed/altered without fiddling with requests) I will add your name as a contributor to the source code. </p>
<p>The one thing that the coder needs to be sure to do is prevent arbitrary input from entering into an AcField parameters. For example calling ->load_unchecked($_POST['some_variable']); will allow arbitrary loading of any row in the table. Additionally, tables, fields, and primary keys should never get passed from/through the client (i.e. AcField(&quot;AcTextbox&quot;, $_GET['field'], ... ). </p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage Guide</h2>
<h3> Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Setup a database.</li>
<li>Set the correct connection string in query_wrapper.php</li>
<li>Set the correct escaping and wrapping functions for your database (default: mysql)</li>
<li>Create a page that pulls from your table structure (include libraries, jquery, AcField, set an output mode, create controls, flush output).</li>

</ul>
